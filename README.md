# Kahoot Answer Bot
A bot that takes the name or ID of a kahoot and gets a perfect score with the nickname of your choosing.

*This project was started by [reteps](https://github.com/reteps/kbot) but is has been broken for quite a while, so I forked it and made it work.*

## Features
The program intercepts and pretends to be a kahoot client. After receiving quiz name from host, looks up answers for quiz and uses them.
- Search by quiz name (requires login) or ID
- 2FA compatible

## Installation
- [ ] Optional: Make a Kahoot Account if you don't have the Kahoot's ID and want to search for a Kahoot by name
- [ ] Install Python3.9

 	- `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/python39.git`
  	- `cd python39`

- [ ] Download and unzip or clone this repo
	- https://github.com/Raymo111/kahoot-answer-bot/archive/master.zip
	- `git clone https://github.com/Raymo111/kahoot-answer-bot.git`
- [ ] Install Dependencies
	- `python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
On other Linux based distros install python3.9 from your package manager.

## Usage
Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory (folder) containing kbot. Then use the following command, replacing `[options]` with any options you want to use (listed below).
```
python kbot [options]
```
```
-e, --email
The email used to login to create.kahoot.it

-a, --password
The corresponding password used to login to create.kahoot.it

-n, --nick
The nickname to join the Kahoot with

-p, --pin
The game pin

-s --search
Search for a quiz without joining a Kahoot. Cancels nick and pin options.

-q, --quizName
The quiz's name

-i, --quizID
The quiz's ID

-d, --debug
Output go print("brrrrrrrrrrrrr") # ;)
```

## Caveats
Does not work when:
- Kahoot is private
- Answers are randomized
- Questions are randomized

This is because this program uses the original question order and answer order, so if these are randomized the wrong answer will be clicked.
